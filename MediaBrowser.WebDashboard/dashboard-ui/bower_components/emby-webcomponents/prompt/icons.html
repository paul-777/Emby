`iron-icons` is a utility import that includes the definition for the `iron-icon` element, `iron-iconset-svg` element, as well as an import for the default icon set.

The `iron-icons` directory also includes imports for additional icon sets that can be loaded into your project.

Example loading icon set:

    <link rel="import" href="../iron-icons/maps-icons.html">

To use an icon from one of these sets, first prefix your `iron-icon` with the icon set name, followed by a colon, ":", and then the icon id.

Example using the directions-bus icon from the maps icon set:

    <iron-icon icon="maps:directions-bus"></iron-icon>


See [iron-icon](#iron-icon) for more information about working with icons.

See [iron-iconset](#iron-iconset) and [iron-iconset-svg](#iron-iconset-svg) for more information about how to create a custom iconset.
